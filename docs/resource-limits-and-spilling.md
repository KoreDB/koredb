# Resource limits, partial results, and out-of-core spilling

This document describes the query resource-limit features (timeout and memory) that return
**partial results** instead of failing, and the **out-of-core spilling** foundation they build
toward. It also records the design and the accounting constraints for the remaining spilling work.

## Motivation

Complex queries (especially many-to-many joins) can grow intermediate state until the query either
runs for a very long time or exhausts memory. Two knobs let a caller bound this and degrade
gracefully instead of losing all work:

- a **time budget** — stop after N milliseconds, return what was produced so far;
- a **memory budget** — stop when the query's buffer usage crosses a limit, return what was produced
  so far.

In both cases the result is a valid **prefix/subset** of the full result, flagged so the caller can
decide how to continue (larger budget, or paginate with `SKIP`/`LIMIT`).

## Features (available now)

### Timeout → partial results

- Setting: `enable_partial_result_on_timeout` (BOOL, **default `true`**).
- With it enabled, a **read-only** query that hits its `timeout` stops early and returns the tuples
  produced so far. With it `false`, the query aborts with an `"Interrupted."` error (the historical
  behaviour). Write queries always abort on timeout (returning a partial result would commit a
  partial mutation).

### Memory limit → partial results

- Setting: `query_memory_limit` (UINT64 bytes, default `0` = disabled).
- When a **read-only** query's buffer-manager used memory crosses the limit, it stops early and
  returns partial results instead of failing with `"Unable to allocate memory"`. This is the
  Redis-`maxmemory`-style "degrade gracefully, don't blow up" behaviour. The database-wide
  `bufferPoolSize` still applies as the hard ceiling; `query_memory_limit` is a per-query soft cap
  below it.

### Result inspection

- `QueryResult::isTruncated()` — `true` if the result is a partial prefix.
- `QueryResult::getTruncationReason()` — `"timeout"`, `"memory_limit"`, or `""` (complete).

Exposed across all bindings: C++, C API (`kuzu_query_result_is_truncated`,
`kuzu_query_result_get_truncation_reason`), Node.js (`result.isTruncated()`,
`result.getTruncationReason()`), Python (`result.is_truncated()`,
`result.get_truncation_reason()`), Java (`result.isTruncated()`, `result.getTruncationReason()`).

### Example (Node.js)

```js
await conn.query("CALL query_memory_limit=268435456;");   // 256 MiB per query
conn.setQueryTimeout(5000);                                // 5 s
const result = await conn.query("MATCH (n)-[r]->(m) RETURN * LIMIT 2000");
if (result.isTruncated()) {
  console.log("partial result, reason:", result.getTruncationReason());
  // "timeout"  -> retry with a larger timeout
  // "memory_limit" -> narrow the query or paginate with SKIP/LIMIT
}
```

## Mechanism: cooperative graceful stop

The historical timeout path *threw* `InterruptException`, which unwound the operator stack and
discarded every partially-collected tuple. Partial results require instead a **cooperative stop**:

1. A soft limit fires:
   - timeout — the task scheduler (`task_scheduler.cpp`) sets `ActiveQuery::timedOut` (when armed);
   - memory — `ClientContext::exceededMemoryLimit()` compares `BufferManager::getUsedMemory()` to
     the armed per-query limit inside `PhysicalOperator::getNextTuple`.
2. `PhysicalOperator::getNextTuple` returns `false` (end-of-stream) instead of throwing. Every parent
   operator treats `false` as "no more input" and finishes normally, so the `ResultCollector` merges
   the tuples it already accumulated. Because each row that reached the collector is a fully-computed
   result tuple, the collected rows are always a **valid subset** of the full result.
3. `ClientContext::executeNoLock` records the reason on the `QueryResult`
   (`setTruncationReason(...)`).

"Armed" means the query is read-only **and** the relevant limit is set. The check is gated so it
costs a single comparison when no limit is configured.

### Known limitations

- **GDS / recursive algorithms** run tight internal loops that bypass `getNextTuple`. They cannot
  produce partial results, so they *enforce* the timeout by throwing (`interruptedOrTimedOut()`), i.e.
  a GDS query that times out errors rather than returning a partial result.
- **`ORDER BY`** interrupted during its accumulation phase returns a sorted *subset*, not necessarily
  the true top-N (once it reaches the scan phase, partial output is a true prefix).
- The memory limit is checked against **total** buffer-manager used memory (intermediates plus
  cached pages), not a per-query working-set counter, so it is an approximation for concurrent
  workloads.

## Out-of-core spilling foundation

The end goal is DuckDB-style out-of-core execution: when memory is tight, spill intermediate state
to disk and *complete* the query, rather than stopping with a partial result. Two reusable
foundation pieces exist:

### 1. Generic spill registry — `SpillableComponent`

`storage::Spiller` was generalized from a hard-coded set of `ChunkedNodeGroup*` to a set of
`SpillableComponent*` (`storage/buffer_manager/spillable.h`). Any component that holds
MemoryManager-backed buffers can register (`addUnusedComponent`) and be asked to spill under memory
pressure (`claimNextComponent` → `SpillableComponent::spillToDisk`). `ChunkedNodeGroup` implements
the interface; behaviour is unchanged.

### 2. Position-independent FactorizedTable serialization

`FactorizedTable::serialize` / `deserialize` (`processor/result/factorized_table.cpp`) write a
table's rows to a **pointer-free** byte stream and read them back at a different address. Each row is
flattened via `FlatTupleIterator` and each value is written self-describingly through
`Value::serialize`, so strings/lists/structs are stored **by value**, not by the absolute pointers
they use in the in-memory overflow buffer. This is the primitive that makes spilling correct for
variable-length data (the reason the raw-buffer spill used by the COPY partitioner cannot be reused
for query results). Currently intended for flat result tables (it flattens factorized columns).

## Remaining work (the large, careful pieces)

1. **Live result-table spill integration.** Wrap a spillable result `FactorizedTable`: serialize to a
   temp file it owns, free its blocks, reload before consumption, and register for the
   memory-pressure trigger.

   **Accounting is the crux.** There are two spill strategies with different memory semantics:
   - *Raw-buffer spill* (what `ChunkedNodeGroup`/`ColumnChunkData` do via `MemoryBuffer::setSpilledToDisk`):
     frees the physical buffer and returns a `SpillResult{memoryFreed, memoryNowEvictable}` that the
     buffer manager uses to update `usedMemory`/`nonEvictableMemory`. Correct **only** for
     position-independent data (fixed-size columns, no overflow pointers).
   - *Serialized spill* (the `FactorizedTable::serialize` path): correct for all types, but freeing
     the source blocks afterwards goes through the normal `MemoryBuffer` destructor —
     `MemoryManager::updateUsedMemoryForFreedBlock` **decrements `usedMemory` only for malloc'd
     (>256 KiB) buffers**; 256 KiB temp-page buffers are returned to `freePages` (reusable but still
     counted in `usedMemory`). So a serialized spill bounds *future* growth (pages get reused) but
     does not by itself lower `usedMemory`, and it must **not** also report a `SpillResult` to the
     buffer manager or memory would be double-counted.

   Getting this contract right, with a unit test that asserts `usedMemory` behaves correctly across
   spill+reload, is the first task of the integration.

2. **`ORDER BY` external merge sort** — spill sorted runs, k-way merge from disk.
3. **Partitioned (Grace) hash join** — the piece that actually fixes many-to-many join blow-up. The
   probe side is random-access, so both inputs must be radix-partitioned by hash and spilled/processed
   partition-by-partition. This is the largest piece.
4. **Partitioned aggregation** — analogous to (3) for the aggregate hash table.

All four reuse the `SpillableComponent` registry and (for correctness on variable-length data) the
`FactorizedTable` serialization primitive.
